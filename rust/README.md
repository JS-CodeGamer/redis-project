# Mini-Redis

Trying to implement redis in rust using mio(tokio-project) for creating event loop.

## Daemon / Server

./daemon folder generates a bin named server that works as server

## Protocol Core

./protocol-core folder is lib for parsing redis protocol (incomplete)

## Cli Client

./cli-client folder generates a bin for named client that works as client (plan to work on this in future)
